<h1 class="sansserif"; align=left>Research Interests</h1>
    <p>Having more than one year of research experience with great Professors at my university and doing five internships in high-tech electronics companies, I found myself taking deep interests in CMOS and Photonic integrated circuits. Below are the research topics I am very excited to invest my time and efforts.</p>
    <h4>CMOS Integrated Circuits:</h4>
        <p class="tight">
            &bull;  <b>Memories:</b> SRAM VLSI Circuits (memory cells, sense amplifiers)<br>
            &bull;  <b>Clock and Data Recovery:</b> PLLs and equilizer circuits<br>
            &bull;  <b>Communication Transceiver circuits:</b> Error correction circuits, Decoders for noisy channel commmunications
    <h4>Photonic Integrated Circuits:</h4>
        <p>
            &bull;  <b>CMOS-Photonic Intagration on single chip:</b> Network-on-chip and chip-to-chip optoelectrical interfaces<br>
            &bull;  <b>Optoelectronics Transceivers:</b> Photodetectors (SPAD arrays), VCSELs and CMOS based VCSEL drivers
        </p>

<h1 class="sansserif";>Research Statement</h1>
<p>There are three main Integrated Circuit areas I am excited to research: Memories, clock and data recovery (CDR), and  communication transceiver circuits.  (1) Memories: I am interested in the research of low voltage and fault tolerant RAMs performing under extensive external radiations making them highly suitable for space-satellite and medical devices. (2) CDR Circuits: PLLs and equalizers used for extracting encoded clock from asynchronous SerDes links are crucial circuit blocks which impacts the bit-error rate in network routing devices.  Therefore, I would like to invest my effort researching those circuits, making them more reliable and energy efficient for optical and wireless communications. (3) Transceiver circuits: I would like to investigate low-energy novel communication blocks in high-speed transceivers such as LDPC/turbo decoders that can enable communication beyond the Shannon limit. This research can help flourish both wireless and power-line IoT applications. I am greatful to my research supervisors Prof. Sachdev, Prof. Gaudet, and Prof. Neale for helping me develop these interests.<br><br>

I also believe that seamless integration of CMOS circuits with silicon photonics can push the processing and data throughput to much higher level. Most of the in-market CMOS processors and memory chips can only be interfaced with another IC through highly capacitive copper traces which limits the maximum throughput to roughly 10 GHz. However, if they were to be designed to easily interface with optical waveguides, couplers, and VCSELs on a same chip, could increase the overall system performance by more than hundred times. This can also lead to improved efficiency and provide better compatibility for faster data throughput through optical mediums. Therefore, I am keen on transforming my CMOS integrated circuits interests mentioned in above paragraphs into CMOS-photonic integration. I thank Dr. Dudley from Apple for giving me great insight in optoelectronics research topics.</p>
